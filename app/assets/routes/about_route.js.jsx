          <h2>How I choose my clothes</h2>
          <p>
            I care a lot about my clothing. Here are some criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Functionality: </strong>
              I should be able to run to work comfortable (in case Im late),
              breathable, versatile, quick-drying, warm
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Appearance: </strong>
              how confident I feel in my clothing,
              how much my girlfriend can stand being with me in public
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Durability: </strong>
              I want the clothing to withstand multiple wears before a wash,
              Hopefully the clothing also lasts a long time in general
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Price Point: </strong>
              I&rsquo;m willing to pay money for quality, but I want to not
              spend too much and the hit the point before diminishing returns
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I want all my clothes to have <em>purpose!</em> That is why each
            item of clothing I own can be marked with it&rsquo;s own purpose.
          </p>
          <h2>Benefits of minimalist wardrobe:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is very easy every day to choose the clothes I need to wear,
              given the particular situation.
            </li>
            <li>
              I feel <em>great</em> in what I wear every day!  Because each item
              of clothing has gone through careful selection, I love all my
              clothes and what they offer to my wardrobe.
            </li>
            <li>
              I rarely feel like I need to go home to change in order to do
              something.  Most of my clothes are multi-functional.
            </li>
            <li>
              I rarely impulse buy.  I know exactly what is missing from my
              wardrobe and thus I can&rsquo;t buy clothing (even when on sale)
              that does not fit a purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              All my clothes dry fast, so I don&rsquo;t use a drier when I do
              laundry!
            </li>
            <li>
              Traveling is super easy!  All my clothes are meant to withstand
              multiple uses, so I almost always travel with just one backpack,
              regardless the duration of the trip.  If a trip is longer,
              I&rsquo;ll just wash my clothes!
            </li>
            <li>
              Moving is super easy!  Almost all of my clothes fits into one box!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Downsides of minimalist wardrobe:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I like wearing colorful clothing, and there aren&rsquo;t many
              companies that make super functional gear in a variety of colors
              and designs.  Many of the clothing is in white, black, blue, and
              gray.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have to really plan out the colors of my clothes because I have
              so few clothes, and basically each item has to match with another.
              For example, it would be difficult to buy colorful pants as my
              only pair because they would have to match with all of my shirts,
              which are all different colors.
            </li>
            <li>
              It becomes more difficult to try out new clothing.  I only buy
              one pair of pants and a few shirts a year, so I face a constant
              decision of whether to stick with what is working versus whether
              to try out a new brand or model.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While my minimalist choices won&rsquo;t work for most people,
            I feel that almost everyone would benefit from being more
            minimalist.  Not many people can say that they love what they
            wear every single day!
